1) Insert the following new client to the clients table (Note: The clientId and clientLevel fields should handle their own values and do not need to be part of this query.): 
Tony, Stark, tony@starkent.com, Iam1ronM@n, "I am the real Ironman"

INSERT INTO 
    clients ( clientFirstName , clientLastName , clientEmail , clientPassword , comments ) VALUES ( 'Tony' , 'Stark' , 'tony@starkent.com' , 'Iam1ronM@n' , 'I am the real Ironman' )

2) Modify the Tony Stark record to change the clientLevel to 3.

UPDATE 
    clients 
SET 
    clientLevel = 3 
WHERE 
    clientFirstName = 'Tony' AND clientLastName = 'Stark'

3) Modify the "Nylon Rope" record to read "Climbing Rope" using a single query. The change must change all instances of "nylon rope" to "climbing rope" in the record. Also, be sure that the invName field maintains its capital letter. (This is a "tricky" one because you have to work with this two word combination [e.g. nylon rope]), while ignoring the word "nylon" if it is not followed by the word "rope". Explore the SQL Replace function. It needs to be part of an Update query as shown in the code examples of the SQL Reading - Read Ch. 1, section 3.

UPDATE 
    inventory 
SET 
    invName = replace('Nylon Rope', 'Nylon', 'Climbing'),
    invDescription = replace(invDescription, 'nylon rope', 'climbing rope')
WHERE 
    invId = 15

4) Use an inner join to select the invName field from the inventory table and the categoryName field from the categories table for inventory items that belong to the "Misc" category. (These resources may help you: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FEjw2HnfDs) Seven records should be returned as a result of the query.

SELECT
	inventory.invName,
    categories.categoryName
FROM
	inventory
INNER JOIN 
    categories 
ON
	inventory.categoryId = categories.categoryId
WHERE 
	categories.categoryId = 3


5) Delete the Koenigsegg CCX car from the database. [Note: You can restore the Inventory table by importing the SQL file that was used to create it again].

DELETE
FROM
	inventory
WHERE
	invId = 7

6) Create a video of you running all of these SQL statements and showing the result of running each SQL statement.
